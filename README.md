# History

In the far 1996 I developed a powerful plug-in for Lightwave 3D 5.0 to improve the Newtek Meta NURBS modeling system, particularly useful to develop organic meshes. 

After 12 years I found again the papers where I printed out enterely the original source code.

It was used from many graphic designers, as you can see [by searching on Google](https://www.google.it/search?client=ubuntu&hs=oAW&ei=PuHlWtLfDcSBU5bKk2g&q=planemetasplitter&oq=planemetasplitter&gs_l=psy-ab.3...3703.3703.0.3794.1.1.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.0.0....0.zr1IuuEfSl4)...
